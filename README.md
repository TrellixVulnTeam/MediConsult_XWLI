# MediConsult
A Google Cloud hosted, Flask web application for aiding communication between Health Assistants and medical professionals to increate quality of healthcare in Myanmar, developed as proof-of-concept.

## About Application

MediConsult is developed as a final year project for my BSc(Hons) Information Technology course.

The main aim of this project is to develop a cloud-based distributed application. The purpose of it is to provide a platform of communication for the healthcare staff stationed or visiting the rural areas to the doctors and specialists in regional hospitals to assist in remote consultation and diagnosis of complex medical issues either in publicly viewable cases or privately using text and video chat. The application also provides tools to systematically submit patientsâ€™ information onto standardised forms which could be reviewed by relevant medical professionals.
